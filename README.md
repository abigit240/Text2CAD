**CAD+LLM: Using LLM integration to build CAD in SolidWorks by Atif**

This is a prototype that enables users to generate CAD geometry in SolidWorks directly from natural language prompts using a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM). The project was made open source to help contritbution from community and further development. As a basic ethical practice it is certainly expected to tag this author in your integrations and further enhancements.

## 🔧 Built Using
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🤖 **Local LLM (Meta’s LLaMA 3)**
- 🌐 **Flask Web Framework**
- 💬 **ChatGPT (for development assistance)**
- 🛠 **SolidWorks (via COM automation)**

---

## 💡 What It Does
- Accepts **natural language input** like:  
  *"Create a solid cylinder with 30mm radius and 40mm height"*
- Parses dimensions and intent using LLM
- Automates **SolidWorks** to build the CAD model via Python scripts
- Shows model response + logs on a clean Flask interface

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repo

       git clone https://github.com/abigit240/Text2CAD.git
       cd Text2CAD


### 2. Setup Python Environment

       pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Setup Local LLM

You need a local LLaMA model. You can run it using llama-cpp-python. Ensure:

The LLM is served as a local endpoint (localhost:11434)

Model used: LLaMA3 (7B recommended for decent performance)
       Example with ollama:
       ollama run llama3

### 4. Start the Flask App

        python app.py

    Then open your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
### 5. Launch SolidWorks

        Make sure SolidWorks is open before generating a model — the script interfaces using its COM API.

💡 Prompt Examples

    A rectangular block of 100mm length, 20mm width, and 20mm height

    Create a solid cylinder with 40mm height and 60mm diameter

❓ Why This Project?

    Generating CAD through natural language is still emerging. Most CAD tools aren't designed to interpret free-form instructions. This project:

    Shows how engineers can leverage LLMs to automate CAD prototyping

    Bridges between natural input and mechanical design tools

    Demonstrates SolidWorks automation via Windows COM API, a lesser-known but powerful capability
